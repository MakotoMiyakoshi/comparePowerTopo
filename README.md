This function is to compare two EEGLAB datasets for their frequency-band powers. This function launches three dialogue windows to let users enter information via Matlab’s GUI. The first window is for entering the path for dataset 1, the second window is for the path for dataset 2, and the third window is for cutoff frequencies for a band-pass filter. It requires full channel information, or at least valid 10-20 channel labels such as Fz, Cz, and Pz. The type of filter used is a FIR Hamming filter (−53 dB per octave) with a fixed transition bandwidth of 1.
